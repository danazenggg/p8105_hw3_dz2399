Problem 1
---------

### First, do some data cleaning:

-   format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” (i.e. no pre-collapsed categories)
-   organize responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
df_brfss <- brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic== 'Overall Health') %>%
  select(-c(class,topic,question,sample_size,confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response))
```

#### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
df_brfss %>% 
  filter(year==2002) %>% 
  spread(key=response, value=data_value) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  mutate(locations = length(unique(locationdesc))) %>% 
  filter(locations == 7 ) %>% 
  distinct(locationabbr)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 1
    ## # Groups:   locationabbr [3]
    ##   locationabbr
    ##   <chr>       
    ## 1 CT          
    ## 2 FL          
    ## 3 NC
